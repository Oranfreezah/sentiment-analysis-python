"[""&#x200B;\n\n[The filter bots...they're back](https://i.redd.it/ebqyxfgjbgl11.jpg)\n\nHey Everyone!\n\n(And a very special *bonjour, hola, hallo, ciao, hej, sveiki, ahoj, buna,* and the rest to our European redditors in particular.)\n\nIt’s September, which means Europe’s back from vacation and we have an update for you on the EU copyright saga and its implications for the open Internet.\n\n[When we last left you](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/) on July 5 (aka [Meme Day](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeDay/)), a truly disastrous version of the EU Copyright Directive was defeated, thanks primarily to the outpouring of concern from netizens rightfully worried about its implications for free expression. You’ll remember that because of the way the draft eliminated copyright liability protections for platforms, the proposed law would have radically changed how sites like Reddit work. It would have forced us to either cut off usage in Europe or install [error-prone copyright filters](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xwkbad/this-music-theory-professor-just-showed-how-stupid-and-broken-copyright-filters-are) on your posts, resulting in a machine-censored user experience and striking a huge blow to the concept of the open Internet.\n\nThe July 5th “no” vote kicked the draft Directive back to the drawing board, and now a flurry of amendments have surfaced. Some are good, but some are just as bad as the original. For anyone who is interested in the nitty-gritty of the amendments, [MEP Julia Reda](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/8oywxz/i_am_mep_julia_reda_fighting_to_saveyourinternet/) has a [pretty good rundown of them here](https://juliareda.eu/2018/09/copyright-showdown/) (note, this issue is fast-moving and amendments are changing daily).\n\nThe bottom line is most of the amendments, short of the proposal to delete Article 13 all together, don’t make an appreciable difference from the last draft in terms of how they would force us to filter your posts (our friends at EDRi [break down why that is here](https://edri.org/copyright-compulsory-filtering-instead-of-obligatory-filtering-a-compromise/)).\n\nThe good news is, this measure—including whatever amendments are adopted—will go to a vote of the FULL European Parliament on September 12. This means that Every. Single. MEP. will have to vote on the record on this issue, and be accountable for that vote come election time. That’s why we’re participating in [A©tion Week](https://saveyourinternet.eu/) to spread the work and help people contact their MEPs. If you live in Europe, you can let your MEP know that this is an issue that you care about, and urge them to reject Article 13. The good folks at [SaveYourInternet.eu](https://saveyourinternet.eu/) have put together a wealth of resources for you to see how your country voted on July 5, look up your MEP, and share your views with them.\n\nCheck it out, and after you’ve called, let us know in the comments what your MEP office said!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: r/Europe has an awesome [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9el2ub/on_the_eu_copyright_reform_iv_second/) going on the vote, with lots of background information on the process itself. They have been THE place on Reddit to go for information on this whole process.

"['Hello all,\n\nRepeating the tradition of creating a back to school megathread as the school year begins for some. Got questions about apparel for high school, college, etc? Worried about dressing down/up from your peers? These and all your other school related questions should go in here. The mods will be changing up our SQ procedures a bit to let people know to put stuff here rather than in SQs.\n\nGood luck in school (particularly for those heading to college this year), and make the most of your time there, which does not mean study all the time. Have some fun with it. If you have questions about college life feel free to ask them here too, I think the amount of people who answer these will probably have a wealth of experiences to share.\n\nThis post will be stickied at the top of the sub later today or tomorrow as well.\n\nBest,\n\nthe mods.\n\n*edits I realized would be helpful:*\n\n***PLEASE INCLUDE A PRICE RANGE, IN USD OR LOCAL CURRENCY.*** It\'s very unhelpful when someone says ""I need x that won\'t break the bank!"" because ""the bank"" can be substantially different for others.\n\nHelpful links:\n\n[Basic Bastard v6](https://www.reddit.com/comments/5da1xt)\n\n[Step by Step Guide for Dressing Better](https://www.reddit.com/comments/1laa42)\n\n[Building Outfits That Work](https://www.reddit.com/comments/19qc8c)\n\n[Developing Personal Style](https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/34ayuf/developing_personal_style_20/)']",[],2018-08-22 00:00:29,['993dji'],[641],[237],['malefashionadvice'],['Back To School Megathread Fall 2018'],['https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/993dji/back_to_school_megathread_fall_2018/']
"[""Things are getting out of hand when it comes to people, toxicity and opinions, and this sub's reputation is suffering because of it. Loving a movie is fine, disliking a movie is also fine. As long as you voice your opinion in a civilized manner then all will be cool. What's not cool is being a dick to someone that doesn't share your opinion. Billy Joe hates TLJ, he has a right to hate it if he wants, that doesn't give you a pass to be a dick to Billy Joe just because you think TLJ should be a multi Oscar winner.
